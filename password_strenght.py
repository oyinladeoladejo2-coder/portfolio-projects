# Implement password_strength(password). 
# Return Weak if the password has fewer than 8 characters.
# Return Medium if it has at least 8 characters but does not contain both letters and digits.
# Return Strong if it has at least 8 characters and contains at least one letter and at least one digit. 
# Students may need to research isalpha and isdigit.
